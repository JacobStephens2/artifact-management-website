# Artifact Manager

This web app is a tool for people to track their artifact use and operationalize commitments to the Minimalists' 90/90 rule.

This site is live at [https://artifact.stewardgoods.com](https://artifact.stewardgoods.com/)

The following LinkedIn Learning courses by Kevin Skoglund were very helpful to me in the development of this app: _PHP Essential Training_, _PHP with MySQL Essential Training: 1 The Basics_, and _PHP with MySQL Essential Training 2: Build a CMS_.
