# artifact-management-tool

This website is a tool for people to track their artifact use and operationalize commitments to the Minimalists' 90/90 rule.

The site is live at [artifact-minimalism.site](https://artifact-minimalism.site/)

The following LinkedIn Learning courses by Kevin Skoglund were very helpful to me in the development of this app: _PHP Essential Training_, _PHP with MySQL Essential Training: 1 The Basics_, and _PHP with MySQL Essential Training 2: Build a CMS_.
